# nanoverse-web
The `nanoverse-web` repository houses the frontend code for the NanoVerse Overload project. This repository is responsible for providing the user interface and client-side logic of the application. It communicates with the GraphQL Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) to fetch and interact with data, and renders the content to end users.
